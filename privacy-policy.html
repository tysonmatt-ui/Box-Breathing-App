Mindful Breathing helps you regulate your autonomic nervous system through guided breathing exercises. The app sends gentle reminders throughout your day, prompting you to pause and take a few mindful breaths.

BREATHING PATTERNS
Choose from five scientifically-informed breathing patterns:
- Calm (4-4-8) — Extended exhale activates your parasympathetic nervous system
- Classic Box (4-4-4-4) — Equal phases for balance and focus
- Relaxing (4-7-8) — Dr. Weil's technique for calm and sleep
- Energizing (6-6) — Rhythmic breathing for alertness
- Extended Calm (5-5-10) — Deep relaxation with longer cycles

SMART REMINDERS
Set your active hours and preferred frequency. The app delivers gentle reminders at random intervals, prompting you to pause and breathe. Works even when the app is closed.

AMBIENT SOUNDS
